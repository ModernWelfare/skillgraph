Added copies of the files with header information to make things easier to understand
Tagged with _WithHeaders



ItemToSkillMapping.txt = item to skill mapping
SkillStructure1.csv = Skill by Skill matrix
CPT_Table1.csv = file with cpt information
	each skill will use this cpt table
	number of parents = rows
	number of parents skills that are known = columns
	cell = probability range
	will use a random value within the range (allow ranges of the same number)

feel free to have the first skill be skill 0 and not skill 1
